This project comes under Lifestyle.

This website has 6 sections - Home, Features, Products, Categories, Review and Blogs. It looks like a professional website. This helps to solve a real-world problem on the field of lifestyle.
It helps to make life easier by bringing nutritous groceries to your doorstep. I have deployed this website as Azure Static Web App.
